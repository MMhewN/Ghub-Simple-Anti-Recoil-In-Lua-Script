# Ghub-Simple-Anti-Recoil-In-Lua-Script
Hi I'm "Mhew" an independent junior developer.

I propose a small script that I made in lua in order to incorporate it into the Ghub software.
The script only works when you press the right click and the left click (aim to shoot).
Use "numLock" on your keyboard to activate/deactivate the script.
The source is easily modifiable even for a newbie:

The base values are 5 and 10. (5 being the force of vibration and 10 the force of pull).

For more vibration increase the first variable in accordance with the second (for example if 5 is not "vibrant" enough, change it to 10 but be sure to put -10 in the second function to counterbalance the "vibration").

For more pull increase the second variable in accordance with the other one (for example if 10 is not strong enough, change it to 15 but be sure to put 15 in the second function).

Feel free to contact me, stay safe.

Love on you.
Mhew.
